Sync inventory and product data between WooCommerce and Square POS. Securely accept payments via the Square payment gateway.

== Description ==

Sync inventory and product data between WooCommerce and Square POS. Securely accept payments via the Square payment gateway.

= Accept credit card payments easily and directly on your store =

The Square plugin extends WooCommerce to allow you to accept payments via Square. Benefit from a **PCI compliant** payment processing option that meets SAQ A levels of compliance.

You can also use these advanced features:

- Support for [WooCommerce Subscriptions](https://woocommerce.com/products/woocommerce-subscriptions/)
- Support for [WooCommerce Pre-Orders](https://woocommerce.com/products/woocommerce-pre-orders/)
- Allow customers to save payment methods and use them at checkout
- Use an enhanced payment form with automatic formatting, mobile-friendly inputs, and retina card icons

= Sync your product catalog with Square =

You can sync your product data automatically between WooCommerce and Square.

- If you sell mainly online, you can choose WooCommerce as your system of record. This will push the WooCommerce product name, inventory, prices, categories, and images to Square. Note that inventory will still be fetched periodically from Square and you must refresh inventory in WooCommerce before editing.
- If you sell in multiple locations and online, you can choose Square as your system of record. This will pull product name, inventory, and prices from Square into your WooCommerce catalog. Product images will also be synced if not already set in WooCommerce.

== Installation ==

You can download an [older version of this gateway for older versions of WooCommerce from here](https://wordpress.org/plugins/woocommerce-square/developers/).

= Automatic installation =

Automatic installation is the easiest option as WordPress handles the file transfers itself and you donâ€™t need to leave your web browser. To
automatically install WooCommerce Square, log in to your WordPress dashboard, navigate to the Plugins menu, and click **Add New**.

In the search field type "WooCommerce Square" and click **Search Plugins**. Once you've found our plugin you can install it by clicking **Install Now**, as well as view details about it such as the point release, rating, and description.

= Manual installation =

The manual installation method involves downloading our plugin and uploading it to your web server via your favorite FTP application. The WordPress codex contains [instructions on how to do this here](http://codex.wordpress.org/Managing_Plugins#Manual_Plugin_Installation).

= Updating =

Automatic updates should work like a charm; as always though, ensure you backup your site just in case.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Does this require an SSL certificate? =

Yes! An SSL certificate must be installed on your site to use Square.

= Where can I find documentation? =

For help setting up and configuring the plugin, please refer to our [user guide](https://docs.woocommerce.com/document/woocommerce-square/).

= Where can I get support or talk to other users? =

If you get stuck, you can ask for help in the [Plugin Forum](https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/woocommerce-square/).
